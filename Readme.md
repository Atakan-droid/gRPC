# gRPC in .NET

## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework. It is a cross-platform framework that can be used to build distributed systems. It is based on Protocol Buffers, which is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible way of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more.

## This code demonstrates how to use gRPC in .NET by creating a console app client and a .NET Core project server.

To use gRPC in .NET, you need to define a service contract using Protocol Buffers, and then generate client and server code using the gRPC tools.

The client and server communicate using HTTP/2, which provides a high-performance, low-latency communication channel.

To run the code, you need to start the server first, and then run the client. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with a message.
